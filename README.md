# techdegree-project-3
 My 3rd Techdegree project

This project is about creating and using form validation. In it, I used regex for validation, along 
with functions, eventlisteners, and logic that help create a realtime form. 

I am going for exceeds. I have included the following to meet this: 
- the color options are hidden in the t-shirt color selection, until a design is picked. 
- with the card number, there is a message asking the user to input a valid card number. 
    But, if a card number that is longer than 16 digits is entered, there is a message 
    displayed telling the user that the number is too long. 
- There is real time validation that happens for the name, email, and card details.
